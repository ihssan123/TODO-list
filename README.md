# 📝 Todo List – Pure JavaScript

This is a lightweight To-Do List web app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks).  
It allows users to:

- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✏️ Mark tasks as completed
- ❌ Delete tasks
- 💾 Save tasks in the browser using `localStorage`

No database, no backend — just pure frontend logic.
